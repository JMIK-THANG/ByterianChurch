                              Pastor Tir was raised in the Presbyterian Church of Myanmar family. His grandfather was one of the founders of the Presbyterian Church of Myanmar and served as an ordained elder of the Church. He received Jesus as his savior and Lord in 1995. His dream is to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather. And also to follow Christ faithfully and serve His will. He has committed his young age to seminary and theological school. He attended Biblical seminary in 1999 when he was 15 and graduated with a Bachelor of Theology in 2006 at Bethel Theological Seminary ( BTS ). While Studying Theology at BTS he also graduated with a Bachelor of Science at Mandalay ( Secular College ) as a distance student. And he has attended the Tahan Theological College for his Master in Divinity, which was accomplished in 2015 from distance.

                              He used to teach and preach the gospel whenever he received a call, excited to serve and preach in unreached cities and villages full of a mission-minded. For the development of the community, he teaches English classes in the summertime. He was married to Lalven Thuang on March 13, 2011, and now he is the father of three lovely kids Lal Biak Muan, Siang Rin Tluang, and Zir Sang Lian, plus waiting for the fourth. He arrived in the United States as a refugee in 2012, after a year he received a call to serve as a pastor of Chin Christian Presbyterian Church of Indiana ( CCPC ), ordained in 2018. Will continue in His ministry until the end of the world.
